The ultimate in Widgets & Features for SiteOrigin Page Builder.

== Description ==
Echelon combines the web's best frontend framework (UIkit) with SiteOrigin's ease of use to create premium level pages at unbelievable speeds. We have included over 30 widgets, 15 core features and a library of over 240 ready to use interface blocks, making the unparalleled front-end power of UIkit available to anyone who can use SiteOrigin Page Builder.

### Flexible Combinations
While our widgets are simple enough to use individually Echelon is unique as all our widgets are designed to be combined together. Combine Loops with Sliders and Filters, Overlays with Light Boxes, Modals with Galleries, Off Canvas with Menus the possibilities are endless, flexible and intuitive.

### Reuse Your Content
Building on the global nature of Echelon we have included a build it once and reuse it system called Echelon Layouts. They provide an area in the WordPress administration (Admin > Echelon Layouts) to store and organize layouts along with a dedicated widget (Reuse Layout) for displaying the content anywhere on your website. If you update the content in the Echelon Layout it will update in all areas you have it displayed.

### Highly Interactive
UIkit has a large array of front end Animations and Transitions available, as such Echelon is by default a highly interactive front-end right out of the box. We didn't stop there though, alongside the baked in interactivity we have included two specific interaction features. The Animate feature will add entrance animations to any widget, row or cell, while the Hover Transition feature with add transition animations to widgets when hovered or focused. You can also trigger Transitions on widgets when using them inside the Slider widget and in loads of other places across the plugin.

### Better Positioning
If you have ever tried to layout widgets horizontally without using columns or a tried to add a dynamic label to a widget you will know its not easy to position elements with Page Builder. UIkit has a plethora of positioning options so theres no reason Page Builder can't use them as well. From absolute and relative positioning to responsive flex box options Echelon can better position your widgets than ever before.

### Responsive Visibility
Sometimes its just not possible to have desktop layouts degrade properly and a dedicated replacement section is needed. Echelon provides a simple Visibility feature to hide widgets rows or cells from certain sized screens. Choose if an element should be displayed on mobiles, tablets, desktops or any combination of the three.

### Background Images
Unfortunately SiteOrigin's background image features are lackluster and minimal, Echelon supercharges backgrounds with some key features sadly missing in the Page Builder core. Choose which image size to use for the background, position the background image, blend the background image with the background color and disable the image responsively are just some of the awesome background image features available with Echelon.

### Custom Color Palette
You know those little color squares displayed under the various color pickers? Thats the Color Palette. Would be great if you could set those to colors of your choosing, now you do just that by going to Appearance > Customise > Echelon > Custom Palette.

### Recent Posts / Products
SiteOrigin allows to you to build templates for loops (Recent Posts, Recent Products) and include them via PHP. Echelon takes this up a notch and provides a easy system to buld loop templates with Page Builder itself. It's super easy too, just add an Echelon Layout and fill with Template tags, WooCommerce Tags and ACF fields then feed it into the Custom Loop widget.

### Prime
We love UIkit and SiteOrigin but we are also fond of electricity and food. Echelon Prime is our paid version and upgrades many of the widgets and features while adding some Prime specific functionality. Echelon is an unlimited product so we have two Prime plans available one for single developers and one for teams.
